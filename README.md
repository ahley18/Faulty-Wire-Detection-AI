# Faulty-Wire-Detection-AI
An AI-powered system for detecting faulty or damaged wires using computer vision and machine learning. This project leverages deep learning models to analyze images or video feeds, identifying potential wiring defects such as fraying, burnt, or improper connections.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📌 How to Use
1. **Train the Model**: Open and run `model_training_v2.ipynb` step by step to train and save the model.
2. **Use the Model**: Load the trained model in `model_V2_with_image.ipynb` to make predictions on images.

## 🚀 Features
- Deep learning-based faulty wire detection
- Supports image-based defect identification
- Easy-to-follow training and inference notebooks

### 📂 File Overview
- `model_training_v2.ipynb` - Notebook for training the detection model.
- `model_V2_with_image.ipynb` - Notebook for testing the model with images.
- `tfrecord.py` - Script for creating TensorFlow record files.
- `builder.py` - Model configuration and utility functions.
- `faulty_wire_model_V2` - Directory containing trained model files.
